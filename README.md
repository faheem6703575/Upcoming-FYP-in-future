Title: Identification of Human Values Behind Arguments Through Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This project aims to analyze textual arguments and identify the underlying human values they reflect using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By extracting these values, the system seeks to understand the motivations and perspectives of individuals in debates, discussions, or written content, contributing to areas like conflict resolution, psychology, and AI ethics.
